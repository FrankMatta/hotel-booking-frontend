# This task involves creating a web application for booking hotel rooms with several features. Here's a breakdown of the tasks

1- Guest Details Form: Create a separate tab on the web application where guests can input their personal information such as first name, last name, city, country, email address, date of birth, and passport details. Once the form is completed, the 'save' functionality should allow the guest's information to be saved and sent via email.

2- Room Functionality: When a guest clicks on the "SELECT ROOM" button, two dropdown menus should appear where guests can select the number of adults and children for their stay. There should also be buttons to 'Add More' or 'Remove' guests. The combination of adults and children should not exceed a maximum of 3 guests.

3- Extra Feature: An 'Extra' feature should be added to the booking system that allows guests to add additional details to their booking. The extra feature should include the price, description, duration, and whether it applies per person or per booking.

4- Backend Functionality: The 'Extra' feature should call a function on the backend of the booking system to save the details based on the guest's selection. Once the booking has been made, the extra feature should be included on the generated invoice.

5- Discount Feature: A dropdown field should be created that automatically detects if the guest stay is 4 or more days. If the guest stay is during High Season (1 Jun to 31 Oct and 21 Dec to 10 Jan), a 10% discount should be applied to the total booking cost. This calculation should be reflected on the generated invoice.

Overall, this task involves creating a comprehensive booking system with features such as guest details form, room selection, extras, discounts, and invoice generation.
